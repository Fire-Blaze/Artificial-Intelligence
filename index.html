        <p style="font-family:Courier; color:LightCoral; font-size:20px; font-weight:bolder;">
         Artificial intelligence (AI) is like a robot with human-like characteristics. It is the ability of a digital computer robot that can perform tasks with intelligence. The name ‘Artificial Intelligence’ was given by John McCarthy. It is known as narrow AI, which means that it is designed to achieve narrow task. However, many researchers are trying to develop general AI, that can perform everyday life tasks while narrow AI was created to do only specific tasks. Philosophers attempt to describe human thinking as a symbolic system, but AI was not discovered until 1956 at the campus of Dartmouth College, in Hanover by John McCarthy. AI is used as Siri in Apple created in 2010 and Alexa which is introduced by Amazon in 2014. <br>
 
It is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. While AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, advancements in machine learning and deep learning, in particular, are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry.<br> 

Artificial intelligence allows machines to model, or even improve upon, the capabilities of the human mind. And from the development of self-driving cars to the proliferation of generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Google’s Bard, AI is increasingly becoming part of everyday life — and an area companies across every industry are investing in.

        <h3 style="font-family:Impact; color:Lavender; font-size:40px; font-weight: normal; font-style: oblique;"> The Pros and Cons of Artificial Intelligence </h3>

<header style="font-family:Verdana; color:Lavender; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;"> The pros of AI are:- </header>

      <ol>
        <li style="font-family:Courier; color:Lavender; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;"> 

It helps reduce the error and increases the chance of reaching accuracy. For example, AI was used in the exploration of space. This type of AI was programmed with information and sent to explore the space. Since these machines are made with metal bodies, they are more resistant and they have a higher ability to tolerate the space and the atmosphere.                  </li>

        <li style="font-family:Courier; color:Lavender; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;"> 

AI can also be used for challenging exploration such as, mining, fuel exploration, and exploring the depths of the ocean floor. These machines can overcome the limited ability of humans. These robots are programmed to do more complicated and hard work with a greater responsibility because it can manage itself.                           </li>

        <li style="font-family:Courier; color:Lavender; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;">

AI can do repetitive jobs because these machines thinks faster than humans so they can be put to multi-tasking. These machines can be employed to do dangerous tasks and they can work all the time, they were programmed to work for long hours and continue doing that without needing breaks, getting tired, or getting distracted.                </li>

        <li style="font-family:Courier; color:Lavender; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;"> 

AI can also be used as medical applications. doctors assess their patients and their health with artificial machine intelligence which can educate them about the side effects of each medicine. Medical professionals are trained with artificial surgery simulators, it can be used to detect brain disorder as it simulates the brain functions.      </li>

<li style="font-family:Courier; color:Lavender; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;"> 
AI is used as digital assistance which can interact with the users. Apple’s assistance, Siri. Was made to help us find information, give us directions, add events to our calendar, helps us send messages and so on. When Amazon first introduced Alexa, which was made to help us scour web pages to find information, shops, schedule appointments, set alarm, and so much more. Tesla is another example of AI; it is a type of car that has a self-driving feature and sheer technological.          </li>

<li style="font-family:Courier; color:Lavender; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;"> 

AI can also predict what users are going to write and check the spelling of the users. Some AI is employed by banks or financial institution to organize the records.       </li>

<header style="font-family:Verdana; color:Lavender; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;"> The cons of AI are:-  </header>
      <ol>
        <li style="font-family:Courier; color:Lavender; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;"> some AIs are programmed to kill. So, if it’s in the hands of the wrong person, it can cause problems. Al was designed to be extremely difficult to turn off so humans can easily lose control when they are in that situation. </li>

        <li style="font-family:Courier; color:Lavender; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;" > AI can be doing the tasks you asked too seriously. AIs were programmed to work hard so, whatever they do, they will take it very seriously. The dependency of humans on these machines are increasing. Since, it helps us in many ways so people are depending on machines. This will cause humans to decrease mental and thinking ability, this problem will continue over time </li>

        <li style="font-family:Courier; color:Lavender; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;"> AI is a very high cost because they are a very complicated machine. Their repair and maintenance require high costs. If the severe breakdowns, it can take a lot of time and costs to get it fixed. AI can’t be improved with experience; it has a lot of data but the way it is accessed and used is very different from human intelligence </li>

        <li style="font-family:Courier; color:Lavender; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;"> Replacing humans with these machines can lead to high unemployment since there is more usage of robotic technology which is more convenient to use and has more intelligence than humans. Humans will have nothing to do, companies and businesses might use more AIs and it would lead to unemployment. </li>

        <h4 style="font-family:Impact; color:PowderBlue; font-size:40px; font-weight: normal; font-style: oblique;"> The Colorful History of Artificial Intelligence </h4>

        <p style="font-family:Courier; color:PowderBlue; font-size:20px; font-weight:bolder;">
          The history of artificial intelligence (AI) began in antiquity, with myths, stories and rumors of artificial beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen. The seeds of modern AI were planted by philosophers who attempted to describe the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols. This work culminated in the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired a handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.<br>

The field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College, USA during the summer of 1956.[1] Those who attended would become the leaders of AI research for decades. Many of them predicted that a machine as intelligent as a human being would exist in no more than a generation, and they were given millions of dollars to make this vision come true.
